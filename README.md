# exchange-app
Simple exchange app project made with API and simple design, that can be used in other projects.

You can see the project in the master branch, using the main just for informing you guys about the project firstly, so you can have a better sight about what it does.

You have to change the API with your key, since the one that I used is a free key and it will not help you with nothing, so I suggest you to keep this in mind.
